# Sound Director Rules

## 1. Core Principles

*   **Style:** Sounds must be bright, vibrant, and have a festive, carnival-like atmosphere. The core goal is a fun, engaging, and casual casino experience with **bouncy, cheerful, and somewhat magical sounds.**
*   **Avoid:** Overly realistic, industrial, or mechanical tones are strictly prohibited. Sounds should feel satisfying and game-like, not like real-world machines.
*   **Duration:**
    *   Standard SFX (spins, stops, clicks, small/medium wins) must be short, ideally under 2 seconds.
    *   Major sounds like a Jackpot win can be longer, up to a maximum of 5 seconds, to create significant impact.
*   **Clarity:** Each sound's purpose must be immediately clear to the player.

## 2. Essential Sound Effects List

The following sounds are required for a complete slot game experience.

*   **`sfx_reel_spin.wav`:** An engaging, loopable sound that builds anticipation. It should be a smooth, magical, or futuristic spinning sound, not a mechanical one.
*   **`sfx_reel_stop.wav`:** A sharp, satisfying "thud" or "click" sound as a single reel comes to a stop. Creates tension and excitement.
*   **`sfx_win_small.wav`:** A short, cheerful, and rewarding "bling" or "chime" sound for minor wins.
*   **`sfx_win_medium.wav`:** A more elaborate and exciting sound for medium-tier wins, with more layers and a slightly longer duration.
*   **`sfx_win_jackpot.wav`:** A spectacular, high-energy, and celebratory sound for the main jackpot, lasting up to 5 seconds. It should be a multi-layered event with rising tones and a clear climax.
*   **`sfx_button_click.wav`:** A crisp, clean, and slightly "bouncy" sound for all UI button interactions.
*   **`sfx_money_in.wav`:** A sound of coins or tokens being counted and added to the player's balance. It should be a positive and satisfying sound.
*   **`sfx_bonus_trigger.wav`:** An exciting, attention-grabbing sound to signal the start of a bonus round or free spins. It should be distinct from win sounds and build excitement.
